# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify a given movie review as **positive** or **negative** based on its textual content.

## Problem Statement:
Given a dataset of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative, the task is to apply Natural Language Processing techniques to preprocess the text and train a classifier that can accurately predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.

## Why It Matters:
Sentiment Analysis helps businesses, media, and platforms understand public opinion at scale. This project simulates a real-world NLP application that can be extended to social media analysis, product reviews, customer feedback, etc.

## Input:
- A text string containing a movie review (e.g., “The film was amazing!”)

## Output:
- A predicted sentiment label: `Positive` or `Negative`
